# Optimizing TAE training and improving ease of tensorizing different models

* The `warmup_test.ipynb` notebook in the `module/` directory contains the basic code for the model and training, with sanity checks along the way to confirm operation.
* `train_utils.py` contains a few utility functions for creating progress bars, defining datasets, and a simple autoencoder training function. `train_utils_features.py` is a notebook illustrating the use of the utils file.
* `base.py` contains a few utility functions, not specific to the project
